The best processor for this socket, based on PassMark score, seems to be the Intel Xeon X5470. This is a quad-core, none hyperthreaded processor that runs at 3.30 GHz. Caveats X5450's use a lot of power, with a TDP of 120 Watts each! A machine equipped with two X5450's, 64 GB of RAM and 4 2.5\" HDDs will draw over 300 Watts at idle . This can be a particular concern if you plan on colo'ing a unit and pay by the amp-hour, or have an amperage limit. RAM Up to 64 GB of DDR2 FB-DIMM ( Fully Buffered ) Ram, as 8 x 8 GB sticks, is supported. Any brand of memory should suffice, but A-Tech produces some of the cheapest 64 GB RAM bundles. Caveats Almost any after market memory suffers from a fairly serious issue. The Base Board Management Controller ( BMC ), the system that controls low-level devices such as the power supplies, fans and so forth, will not be able to read the temperature sensor integrated into each RAM stick. This will result in the cooling fans running much faster than usual under normal conditions -- for example idle conditions will produce speeds around 9-10K RPM instead of about 3-4.5K. As a result the server will be very, very loud. While there are ways to somehwhat control the BMC via Dell provided tools and custom BMC image flashing, none of these methods allow the fan speed threshold to be controlled. Storage Stock Hard Drive Bays The Poweredge 1950 could either be optioned with two 3.5\" quick-swap HDD bays or 4 2.5\" bays. These drives are connected to the back-place and the integrated RAID controller An extra SATA port Generation I and II versions of the Poweredge 1950 used an IDE bus to control the integrated optical drive. Generation III models added a lone SATA I bus to the main board, which was designed to replace the only IDE bus and control a SATA optical drive. Gen. III main power lead also had a small break-out cable to supply the 5 volts required by the optical drive. As fate would have it, the SATA bus and 5 volt power are exactly what is required to run a 2.5\" HDD. By using an \"Optical drive to HDD adapter\", such as this one the optical drive can be swapped out for an additional 2.5\" HDD. However this drive will not be accessible by the RAID controller and cannot be assigned to a RAID array with the main drives that connect to the back-plane. An extra USB port Generation III models of the Poweredge 1950 included a very curiously positioned USB port in the middle of the main board. Apparently this was supposed to be used for cryptography hardware keys -- fortunately it is just a normal USB 2.0 port. This allows for some fairly inserting possibilities. For example, with some clever cable routing, a USB-to-SATA converter and a 2.5\" HDD PCIe slot adapter an extra HDD can be added to the system, assuming there are empty PCIe slots available. There is also just enough space for a small USB thumb drive, An extra SAS port The integrated RAID controller comes equipped with two SAS ports, only one of which is used by the back-plane. This is probably due to the RAID controller being shared between the Poweredge 1950 and 2950, a unit that could support many more HDDs. By using a SAS-to-SATA break-out cable, like this one up to 4 additional HDDs can be attached to RAID controller. Of course there is no additional power or space available inside the server case, but if an external drive enclosure and power supply is used 4 HDDs can be provisioned by the RAID controller.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"hardware/#overview-of-hardware","text":"","title":"Overview of Hardware"},{"location":"hardware/#processor","text":"The Poweredge 1950 comes equipped with 2 LGA771 processor slots.

However, with enough work GPUs can be used PCIe Slots Available The Poweredge 1950 can be equipped with either two PCI-X risers, or two PCIe 2.0 8x risers. Note that these cannot be mixed and matched, it must be either two PCI-X risers, or two PCIe risers. Since there are a very limited number of PCI-X graphics cards available, none of which are any good, for GPU use the two PCIe risers will are almost always used. Caveats The PCIe 2.0 standard dictates that PCIe slots should provide 25 watts of power to standard devices and up to 75 watts to devices identified as \"high power\" such as graphics cards. However, it seems that the 8x PCIe slots do not comply with this part of the standard and will only supply up to 25 watts to any device. Using a Graphics Card as a VGA Device In order to use graphics cards as VGA devices, which is required for graphics output and OpenCL/CUDA device use, the iDRAC remote management card will need to be removed. In general the system will boot just fine with the iDRAC in place, but any attached graphics cards will not show up as valid VGA devices on boot. By removing the iDRAC and resetting the BIOS graphics cards can be used as VGA devices, as per usual. Using Graphics Cards that Require = 25 Watts Graphics cards that draw less than 25 watts will, generally not run afoul of power draw issues. However not every card will be recognized by the BIOS, and there doesn't appear to be any way to tell a prior which cards will work. Using Graphics Cards that Require 25 Watts Any card that is rated at 75 watt power usage will generally cause a POST failure with an PCIe riser error, assuming only power from the PCIe slot is used. However, if 12 volt power is supplied from an external source the card will usually work as intended. As a word of caution a power supplied to the card should always use the same ground reference. That is, using the 12 volt power from the PCIe rail and auxiliary power from an external power supply is not recommended . Power should either be supplied from the 12 volt sources available on the main board ( or the two power supplies ) or entirely from an external power supplies, as is the case when using a PCIe extender and external power supply. Using an External Power Supply Using an Internal Power Supply Resetting the BIOS Any time the iDRAC card is removed from or added to the system the BIOS will need to be reset or the system will hang on POST. The order to reset the BIOS the NVRAM_CLR jumper will need to be set to the \"clear\" position and the system will need to be boot cycled. A page from the maintenance manual for setting the NVRAM_CLR jumper is shown below.

The names of packages and specific installation steps will almost certainly differ if a different distro or Debian version is used. Disk Partitioning Scheme The Poweredge 1950 in question is equipped with 4x 2.5\" HDD bays that connect to the back-plane and PERC 6/i RAID controller. In addition the optical drive bay was removed and replaced with a housing for an additional 2.5\" HDD which is attached to the internal SATA 1.0 port. These drive bays are populated with the following hardware: Back-plane Independent SATA 1.0 4 x Seagate Constellation.2 1 TB, 7200 RPM 1 x Seagate Spinpoint M9T 2TB, 5400 RPM These resources will be used in the following way: Base OS General Storage Low Speed NAS 120 GB RAID 0 ~2.67 GB RAID 5 ~ 2 TB Independent In practice a RAID 5 array with the hardware listed above yields read/write speeds of \\~ 300 MB/s and the independent 2 TB drive yields \\~ 100 MB/s. We want to reserve the (relatively) high speed volumes for use by our base OS and for applications where I/O performance might be a consideration. The SATA 1.0 port on the main board is not managed by the RAID controller and any attached HDD has to be used as a totally independent volume. This means that we will have access to almost the full storage available on the disk, but lower I/O speeds. Because of this we reserve the 2 TB volume for long-term storage or for applications where I/O performance is not critical. Setting up RAID Arrays Setting up Extra SATA HDD Firmware The Ethernet adapters used by the Poweredge 1950 require firmware from the firmware-bnx2_0.43 package in order to operate. This firmware can be installed during initial set-up or afterwards. For obvious reasons it's easier to install this package during initial installation, because once the system is set-up without it we won't have access to the internet and will need to install the package manually using removable media of some sort. Base + Non-Free LiveCD There is a special LiveCD image that includes the base Debian 9.5 system and all of the \"non-free\" firmware, of which the bnx2 firmware is a subset. Using this image should mean the Ethernet adapters function normally out-of-the-box. Manual Installation During Install Alternatively a base Debian image can be used and the firmware can be loaded during the LiveCD installation. The compressed firmware file package needs to be downloaded, uncompressed, and placed on a removal media device. During installation the missing firmware-bnx2_0.43 will be identified. By selecting firmware-bnx2_0.43.all.deb file on the previously prepared removal media device, the missing firmware will be installed and the Ethernet adapters should function normally. Manual Installation After Install We can also install our missing firmware after the base OS is set-up. Once again we need to grab the compressed firmware file package uncompress it, and place the uncompressed files on a removal media device. We can then copy the firmware-bnx2_0.43.all.deb file onto the host system and install it with dpkg . sudo dpkg -i firmware-bnx2_0.43.all.deb Since we didn't have a network connection accessible during the LiveCD installation our apt sources will be set to local LiveCD versions. Now that we have the proper firmware installed to use our Ethernet adapter we need to change out apt sources to reference the main Debian repos instead of these local versions. We need to open up /etc/apt/sources.list using whatever text editor we choose... sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list ... and replace the entire file with the following. deb http://deb.debian.org/debian stretch main deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian stretch main deb http://deb.debian.org/debian-security/ stretch/updates main deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian-security/ stretch/updates main deb http://deb.debian.org/debian stretch-updates main deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian stretch-updates main Unfortunately these changes will result in target conflicts..

If we used the \"guided partition\" option offered by the Debian installer it will automatically allocated ~64 GB of space to swap . Since our system has 64 GB of RAM this is a truly excessive amount of swap space. We can either partition our system manually during installation, or after installation using gparted or similar. Mounting HDDs By default only the small 120 GB partition that holds the OS will be mounted on boot.
